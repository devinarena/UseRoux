                <h1>Use Roux</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome! This is an interactive guide site for using the superior cubing method, Roux.</p>
                <p>You can use the buttons above to navigate through each individual step of solving the cube.</p>
                <p>You can use your mouse or finger to orbit around the cube by pressing and dragging. The scroll wheel and pinching can be used to zoom in/out.</p>
                <p>The scramble shown in this example is (green front, white top):</p>
                <p>U2 B2 D' B R' D F' R U F2 L2 F2 L2 U2 F L2 B' U2 B' L2 U2</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-dialog hidden">
                <h1>First Block</h1>
                <p>The first step for solving the cube using Roux is to solve a 2x3x1 block on the left side.</p>
                <p>This step is complete intuition, look for pairs that are already made or easy to make.</p>
                <p>Try and track pieces during inspection so you don't need to try and look ahead, which is very difficult at this point.</p>
                <p>For this example, you can easily solve first block with blue on the side and white on the bottom using:</p>
                <p class="algorithm"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-dialog hidden">
                <h1>Second Block</h1>
                <p>For second block, as you probably guessed, we'll be creating the opposite block on the other side.</p>
                <p>This step is also intuition, insert the center's edge, then make both pairs and insert them.</p>
                <p>You likely won't be able to track this step during inspection, but you may be able to track the edge to insert. You can use lookahead to improve times during this step.</p>
                <p>For this example, after solving the first block, you can solve the second block with green on the side and white on bottom using: </p>
                <p class="algorithm"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-dialog hidden">
                <h1>CMLL</h1>
                <p>This is the only algorithmic step in all of Roux (besides very short and unnecessary 4a algorithms). Similar to OLL, just grind the algorithms until you have them all memorized (there is about half the amount in CFOP).</p>
                <p>Some recognition can be difficult, so try slow solves to work on recognizing CMLL cases.</p>
                <p>TODO: INSERT LIST OF CMLL ALGS</p>
                <p>For this example, the CMLL algorithm is just:</p>
                <p class="algorithm"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-dialog hidden">
                <h1>4a</h1>
                <p>The last step of Roux is step 4 and is split into an a, b, and c part. 4a involves orienting all white and yellow edges on the cube.</p>
                <p>In order to orient white and yellow edges, our first goal is to get the good arrow on top of the cube. The good arrow is three unoriented edges on top of the cube in the shape of an arrow.</p>
                <p>After getting the good arrow, point it towards the unoriented edge on the bottom of the cube and use:</p>
                <p>Forward arrow: M' U/U' M/M'</p>
                <p>Backward arrow: M U/U' M/M'</p>
                <p>Theres a short list of algorithms, though this step can be done intuitively easily.</p>
                <p>For this example, you can orient all the edges after CMLL using:</p>
                <p class="algorithm"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="guide-dialog hidden">
                <h1>4b</h1>
                <p>4b is the second part of step four and involves solving the UL/UR edges (the top edge on the left and right side of the cube).</p>
                <p>You can solve these edges by placing the UL edge in the front bottom slot and the UR edge in the back bottonm slot or vice versa.</p>
                <p>After place the opposite side corners above the edges and do an M2. </p>
                <p>This step is completely intuitive, a hint is to get an edge in the back or front bottom slot, then place the opposite edge across from it diagonally on the cube. M' U2 M or M U2 M' then aligns the edges for insertion.</p>
                <p>For this example, you can solve the UL/UR edges after 4a using: </p>
                <p class="algorithm"></p>

                <h1>4c</h1>
                <p>4c the final part of solving a cube using Roux. It is also the easiest step.</p>
                <p>There are 3 total cases each with 1 or 2 variants and a short algorithm to accompany it. None of these algorithms are necessary and the cube can be intuitively solved for all of step 4.</p>
                <p>TODO: INSERT A LIST OF 4c algorithms</p>
                <p>For this example, the cube is solved after doing:</p>
